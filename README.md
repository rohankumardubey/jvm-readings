# JVM Readings

WORK IN PROGRESS

A list of papers and blog posts essential to understanding how the JVM works, and building high performance applications on the JVM. The list is curated and maintained by Reynold Xin ([@rxin](https://twitter.com/rxin)). If you think a paper should be part of this list, please submit a pull request. It might take a while since I need to go over the material.

Also see my other reading list: [Readings in Databases](https://github.com/rxin/db-readings)

Method Dispatch

This is a good blog post about the cost of polymorphic dispatches. But more importantly, it is a good blog post to understand performance measurement methodology.
